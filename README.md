## About the Project

This project is intended to make the development of ecommerce apps eaisier through the development of a basic template.  The future plan for this is to complete a full workflow process nessesary to setup brand and product customization to a very abstracted process. I.e I want to make a template that is easy and fast to use for freelance developers like me.  

## Getting Started 

to start the program type "npm start" in your CLI. This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


## Testing

To run the test suite type "npm test" in the CLI. This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Build 

To build the app in production mode type "npm build" into your ClI. This Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Enjoy

I am a big recreation type. Making things simple so that I can spend more time outside is the name of the game. My hope is that this will do just that for you.  Enjoy the engeneering and then get outside and enjoyt the world!
